"""Import-probe a pinned MiniMax H3 source package without trusting its root.

Two callers, and they want different strictness — hence `--verify-seams`:

  - `isByovRuntimeReady` (server/services/videoGen/runtimes.js) runs this bare,
    as a readiness check. It must answer ONLY "can this runtime render at all",
    because a false negative there sets `byovGateBlocked` in the Video Gen page
    and disables Generate outright. Same rule minimax_h3_lora_probe.py is kept
    separate for: a runtime that is perfectly healthy for plain renders is never
    marked unready over a capability it doesn't need.

  - `scripts/setup-image-video.sh` runs it WITH the flag at Install / Repair,
    where the extra strictness is what the user asked for and a failure is
    actionable at the action that caused it.

The flag adds `verify_pinned_seams()`: every method of the pinned encoder that
`generate_minimax_h3.py` patches, asserted up front. Those adapters are only
correct against the exact implementation they were written for, and their
render-time guards otherwise fire minutes later — after a cache resolve and a
pipeline load, and only on the image-conditioned path three of them serve. A pin
bump reaches Install / Repair anyway (a moved MINIMAX_H3_EXPECTED_REVISION fails
`isByovRuntimeCurrent`, and a re-locked mlx-vlm needs a re-sync), so gating the
strict check there costs no coverage a stock user would ever have seen.
