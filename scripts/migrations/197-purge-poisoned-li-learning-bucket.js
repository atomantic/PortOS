/**
 * Purge the Layered Intelligence learning bucket poisoned by the commit-criterion
 * bug (#2700).
 *
 * Background:
 *   An LI run is a REASONING run: its prompt explicitly forbids committing or
 *   opening a PR (the worktree is discarded), and it returns its result through the
 *   `.agent-done` sentinel for an output hook to file. But `evaluateSuccessCriteria`
 *   only knew one machine-checkable criterion — a `[task-<id>]` commit — and fell
 *   through to it for LI. Since a declared verdict OVERRIDES the runner's exit code
 *   in task-learning (`outcomeSuccess` in taskLearning/metrics.js), every correctly
 *   executed LI run was recorded as a FAILURE.
 *
 *   `agentLifecycle.js` now exempts programmatic-I/O task types from that criterion,
 *   the same way pipeline/media jobs already were. But that fix is PROSPECTIVE: an
 *   install that has already run the agent-backed LI task carries a bucket whose
 *   `succeeded`/`successRate`/`recentOutcomes` are fabricated failures.
 *
 *   That stale data is not inert. The new `selfEval` LI source (#2700, default-ON
 *   for the PortOS install) reads this exact bucket to judge whether the loop's own
 *   execution is healthy, and would read the poisoned history as a ~0% success rate
 *   — permanently reporting "your execution is DEGRADED" and steering the reasoner
 *   away from filing, on evidence that was never true. The same numbers also feed
 *   routing, the CoS Learning card, and duration estimates.
 *
 * Approach:
 *   DELETE the bucket rather than trying to repair it. The recorded outcomes cannot
 *   be reconstructed: `validationPassed:false` overwrote the runner's real verdict,
 *   so the truth of each historical run is simply not on disk. Deleting resets LI to
 *   an honest "no runs recorded yet" — which the readers already model correctly
 *   (`readLiTaskMetrics` returns `{ read: true, metrics: null }` for an absent
 *   bucket, and selfEval renders "no LI runs recorded yet" and withholds the
 *   execution-health signal from its confidence math). Inventing a success rate to
 *   replace it would be the same sin in the opposite direction.
 *
 *   Reuses `removeTaskTypeFromLearningData` rather than hand-rolling the removal.
 *   The bucket is not the only place the fabricated failures landed — they were also
 *   folded into `totals`, `byModelTier`, `routingAccuracy`, `errorPatterns`,
 *   `failureSignatures`, and `correlationWindow`. Deleting only `byTaskType` would
 *   leave the global success rate (the CoS Learning card) and routing still skewed
 *   while reporting success, and a second hand-written unwind here would drift from
 *   the runtime's as aggregates are added.
 *
 *   Environmental failures are deliberately PRESERVED. `shouldDivertToEnvironmental`
 *   routes rate-limit/auth/network events to their own ledger and never into
 *   `byTaskType`, so they are recorded from real errors and are true regardless of
 *   this bug — unlike `resetTaskTypeLearning`, which purges them because a
 *   user-initiated reset means "forget this type entirely". This migration repairs
 *   mis-recorded data; it must not destroy a genuine outage history.
 *
 *   Scoped to `self-improve:layered-intelligence` — the ONLY registered
 *   programmatic-I/O task type (taskTypeHooks.js `HOOK_MODULES`), so no other bucket
 *   was affected by the bug and none are touched here.
 *
 *   No-op by construction on installs that never ran LI (the common case) — the
 *   file is only rewritten when the bucket is actually present.
 *
 *   This purge identifies its target by bucket PRESENCE, so a rerun after
 *   data/migrations.applied.json is lost/corrupt would drop legitimately-earned
 *   post-fix history. It therefore opts into the runner's PURGE class
 *   (`purge: true`): run-migrations.js records a purge migration as applied
 *   WITHOUT executing it whenever the applied-list started empty/rebuilt (#2770).
 *   The guard lives in the runner and is shared with migration 198 — no
 *   per-migration marker to drift.
