"""What "the pinned MiniMax H3 MLX text encoder" means, stated once.

`generate_minimax_h3.py` patches four methods of
`minimax_h3_mlx.text_encoder.MiniMaxH3TextEncoder` at render time, and every one
of those patches is only correct against the exact implementation it was written
for. This module holds the facts that define "exact": which methods have to be
there, which of them has to still be a property, the merge line the encode
correction replaces, and the digest of the whole `encode` it copies.

Both readers import it, so there is one copy to re-record when the pin moves:

- the runner, whose corrections keep guarding their own seam — that is the last
  line of defence for a checkout overridden after install; and
- `minimax_h3_runtime_probe.py`, which runs at Install / Repair and calls
  `verify_pin_seams()` there, so whoever bumps `MINIMAX_H3_EXPECTED_REVISION`
  (server/services/videoGen/runtimes.js) hears about a moved pin at the action
  that moved it, rather than minutes into a failed keyframe render.

A failed seam therefore leaves the whole runtime reported unready, not just the
render mode that seam serves — deliberately. `verify_runtime_checkout()` already
byte-verifies the checkout against the expected revision, so a stock install can
never reach these assertions: the only way to fail one is to have moved the pin,
and stopping there is the point.

MLX only, deliberately: `generate_minimax_h3_cuda.py` runs diffusers'
`MiniMaxH3ModularPipeline` with no source checkout to pin and nothing to patch,
so none of this is true of it — checkpoint facts the two runners DO share live
in `_minimax_h3_common.py` instead.

Stdlib-only at import time like that sibling: `minimax_h3_mlx` and `mlx_vlm` are
imported inside the functions that need them, so importing this module never
assumes a registered source namespace or a loaded runtime.
