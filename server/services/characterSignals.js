/**
 * Character Signal Context (#2676, epic #2672)
 *
 * ONE read per domain stat, shared by every surface `getCharacter()` derives on read.
 *
 * The Character sheet now derives two things from the same domain stats: the per-domain
 * `skills` (#2674) and the `metrics` grid (#2676). Most of the signals below feed BOTH —
 * Wordsmith and `recordsCreated` are the same three reads, Mentalist and `postStreakDays` are
 * the same two, and so on. Letting each registry call the getters itself would have doubled
 * the fan-out of a route the CyberCity HUD polls every 15s, so the reads moved here and both
 * registries now take a `read` function instead of importing the getters directly.
 *
 * **Per-request, never module-level.** `createSignalContext()` mints a fresh cache per
 * `getCharacter()` call. A module-level cache would be a correctness bug, not an
 * optimization: these stats change as the user uses PortOS, and a sheet that never notices
 * the session you just logged is worse than a slow one.
 *
 * **Failures propagate; they are not classified here.** A reader that rejects makes `read()`
 * reject with the same error, and the *consumer* decides what that means (both registries
 * turn it into an explicit `unavailable`, never a fake 0 — see `readSkill` / `readMetric`).
 * This module stays a cache, not a policy. A failed read is cached like any other, so a
 * downed Postgres is hit once per request rather than once per skill AND once per metric
 * that reads it.
 *
 * **Every reader must be able to report failure (#2726).** That propagation is only worth
 * anything if the readers actually reject when they can't read. The DB-backed ones always
 * did (a failed `query()` throws), but the file-backed four bottom out in `readJSONFile`,
 * which returns its default on *every* read error — so an unreadable file arrived here
 * indistinguishable from an empty one and scored a real-looking 0. They now pass
 * `{ strict: true }`, which throws on a present-but-unreadable/corrupt file while still
 * treating a genuinely absent one (ENOENT) as the trustworthy empty it is. This is the ONLY
 * place that opts in: every other caller of those getters keeps the swallow-and-default
 * behavior, which is correct for a UI that should degrade rather than break.

/**
 * Every domain stat the derived Character surfaces are allowed to read, keyed by signal id.
 * Adding a signal here is the ONLY way to add a read — a registry that reaches for a getter
 * directly re-opens the duplicate-read hole this module exists to close.
 *
 * These are tallies or already-aggregated summaries, never listings: `countUniverses` /
 * `countWorks` / `countMemories` / `countAssets` are `COUNT(*)`s (#2729), so no consumer can
 * accidentally materialize every record just to read a `.length`. `loggingStats`'
 * `activeDayKeys` is the one bounded exception — a de-duplicated day key per ACTIVE DAY, not
 * per record — because a day-set union has no aggregate form (#4120).
 *
 * The file-backed readers pass `{ strict: true }` — see the header. Keep it on any reader
 * added here whose source can swallow a read error, or the signal silently becomes a lie
 * the consumers have no way to detect.
