# HTML compositions

Render a local, seekable HTML scene to a text-faithful H.264 MP4 without an AI
provider. Start the managed browser and install ffmpeg before submitting a job.
Chrome must support CDP hidden targets; unsupported browsers fail the job rather
than opening a visible tab.

Put `index.html` and its assets in a directory such as
`data/compositions/example/`. The page exposes:

```html
<div id="block" style="position:absolute;width:40px;height:40px;background:red"></div>
<script>
globalThis.portosComposition = {
  durationSec: 2, fps: 24, width: 1280, height: 720,
  async seek(t) {
    document.getElementById('block').style.left = `${t * 200}px`;
  }
};
</script>
```

`seek(t)` must finish all asynchronous work for that frame before resolving.
Drive animation from `t`, not wall-clock playback, CSS animation timers or random
state. The renderer awaits each seek, then captures frame `n` at `n / fps`.
Duration is 1–120 seconds, fps is an integer from 12–60, and their product must
be a whole number of frames. Dimensions are exactly 1920×1080, 1080×1920,
1080×1080 or 1280×720. Invalid contracts name the field in the job error.

Submit `POST /api/html-composition/render` with:

```json
{"directory":"compositions/example","musicTrack":"example.wav"}
```

`musicTrack` is optional and names an existing Music-library file. It loops if
shorter than the video, is trimmed to duration, and fades out over the final half
second. A missing requested track fails the job.

The 202 response contains the media queue's `jobId`. Subscribe to
`GET /api/html-composition/:jobId/events` for the usual queued, started, progress,
complete, error and canceled SSE frames. Cancel through
`POST /api/html-composition/:jobId/cancel` or the existing media-job controls.
Jobs use the serialized local lane and are never offered to a federated peer.

The renderer snapshots local assets (up to 256 MiB / 4096 files), rejects
symlinks, and fulfills requests from that snapshot at a virtual HTTPS origin.
Use relative asset URLs. Nothing is served by a new HTTP listener. A fresh,
hidden browser target has no access to the operator's normal browser context.
Network URLs, missing assets, frames, workers, popups, WebSockets and WebRTC are
refused; a refusal fails the job instead of silently dropping content. Browser
disconnects, failed encoding and cancellation remove partial outputs. Cancellation
is refused once the final history write has begun.

Successful outputs have BT.709 tags, fast-start MP4 layout, and a thumbnail in
Media History. Source compositions are externally editable files, not a new
relational store. Outputs and job state use the existing video-history and media
queue storage contracts; no new JSON store, migration, seed or sync channel is
introduced. Source files under `data/` follow the existing backup filters.

The real-browser contract suite in
`server/services/htmlComposition/index.test.js` needs Chrome and ffmpeg. It uses
a temporary browser profile and data root, never the live managed browser.
Set `CHROME_PATH` when Chrome is not in a standard location. The suite skips
explicitly when either binary is unavailable; route and queue tests still run.
