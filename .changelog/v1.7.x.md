# Release v1.7.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Personalized taste prompting, behavioral feedback loop, and expanded aesthetic domains for the Digital Twin.

## Features

### Personalized Taste Prompting (M42 P2.5)
- Added LLM-generated personalized follow-up questions that reference identity documents (BOOKS.md, AUDIO.md, CREATIVE.md, PREFERENCES.md, PERSONALITY.md, enrichment answers, existing taste responses)
- "Go Deeper" button appears after a section's static questions are complete — generates a personalized question using identity context and selected AI provider
- Personalized questions shown with distinct purple "Personalized — referencing your identity" badge
- Answers to personalized questions stored with `source: 'personalized'` metadata and the generated question text for audit trail
- Identity context aggregation reads up to 2000 chars from each identity doc, cross-section taste responses, and enrichment progress to build a ~4000 char context window for the LLM
- New API endpoint: `POST /api/digital-twin/taste/:section/personalized-question`

### New Taste Sections: Fashion & Digital
- **Fashion & Texture** (`fashion`): material/fabric preferences, color wardrobe, formality spectrum, style identity, anti-fashion positions — with follow-ups for texture sensitivity, natural materials, minimalist wardrobe, color expression, and vintage aesthetics
- **Digital & Interface** (`digital`): dark/light mode preferences, information density, animation tolerance, tool aesthetics, notification/attention style — with follow-ups for dark mode specifics, minimal vs dense UI, software craftsmanship, and digital focus management
- Total taste sections expanded from 5 to 7

### Behavioral Feedback Loop (M34 P3)
- "Sounds like me" / "Not quite" / "Not me" validation buttons on behavioral test responses and taste profile summaries
- Feedback stored with content type, snippet, provider/model attribution, and timestamp
- Feedback statistics dashboard in TestTab: total ratings, validation rate percentage, per-validation breakdown, and recent accuracy trend (improving/declining/stable)
- Document weight recalculation from feedback history — documents consistently associated with validated responses get boosted, contradicted ones get reduced
- New API endpoints: `POST /api/digital-twin/feedback`, `GET /api/digital-twin/feedback/stats`, `POST /api/digital-twin/feedback/recalculate`, `GET /api/digital-twin/feedback/recent`
