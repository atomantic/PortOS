## 🔧 Improvements

### Chief of Staff Task Management
- **Separate Active Tasks from Pending**: Task list now clearly distinguishes between pending, active (in_progress), blocked, and completed tasks
  - Pending tasks shown in yellow section (waiting to be started)
  - Active tasks shown in blue section with animated pulse indicator (currently running)
  - Blocked tasks shown in red section (waiting for external factors)
  - Completed tasks remain collapsible in green section
  - Applies to both User Tasks (TASKS.md) and System Tasks (COS-TASKS.md)
  - Makes it immediately clear which tasks are actively being worked on vs queued

### Architecture
- **Monorepo with npm workspaces**: Converted root package.json to support workspaces
  - Workspace packages: `packages/*`, `server`, `client`
  - Enables sharing code between main app and reusable packages
  - Foundation for extracting more shared libraries

### API
- Added `GET /api/directories` endpoint for browsing file system directories
  - Returns current path, parent path (if available), and list of subdirectories
  - Filters out hidden directories (starting with `.`)
  - Defaults to parent of PortOS project directory when no path specified

### UI Components
- New `DirectoryPicker` component in `client/src/components/DirectoryPicker.jsx`
  - Dropdown interface with folder icons and navigation
  - Real-time directory browsing without typing paths
  - Keyboard and mouse navigation support

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Chief of Staff - Multi-Provider CLI Support
- **Fixed Codex CLI provider support**: Agent spawner was hardcoded to use Claude CLI arguments regardless of selected provider
  - Added `buildCliSpawnConfig()` function for provider-specific CLI invocation
  - Codex CLI now correctly uses: `codex exec --model <model>`
  - Claude CLI continues using: `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --print --model <model>`
  - Updated cos-runner to accept `cliCommand` and `cliArgs` parameters
  - Maintains backwards compatibility with legacy `claudePath` parameter
