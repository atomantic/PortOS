# Release v1.21.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Production PM2 process management.

## Fixes

- **`npm start` uses PM2** — production start now launches the server via PM2 instead of a bare `node` process, so PortOS appears in `pm2 list` and can be managed with standard PM2 commands
