# Release v1.4.x - Changelog

Released: Unreleased

## Overview

Cross-platform compatibility improvements for Windows and exFAT filesystems.

## Fixes

### Windows: spawn ENOENT for pm2 and npm commands
- All `spawn('pm2', ...)` and `execFile('pm2', ...)` calls now use `shell: true` on Windows (`process.platform === 'win32'`), where pm2 is a `.cmd` wrapper that `spawn` can't find without shell
- Affects: autofixer, browser service, CoS, log streaming, pm2 service, scaffold, socket service
- Also fixes `spawn('npm', ...)` in scaffold route (same `.cmd` issue)

### Windows/exFAT: npm install symlink failure
- Removed npm `workspaces` config from root `package.json` — workspaces always create symlinks which fail on exFAT (no symlink support)
- The `install:all` script and setup scripts already handle per-directory installs independently, so workspaces were unnecessary

### Cross-platform path separators in PM2 config
- `ecosystem.config.cjs` now uses `path.join()` instead of string concatenation for the Vite script and client cwd paths, avoiding mixed separators on Windows
