# Release v0.17.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

JIRA integration improvements and token lifecycle management.

## Features

### JIRA token expiry tracking and warning
- **Tracks `tokenUpdatedAt`** on each instance when a PAT is saved, separate from `updatedAt` which changes on any edit
- **Client shows expiry warnings** based on 30-day PAT lifetime: yellow warning at 5 days remaining, red alert when expired
- **Handles legacy instances** without `tokenUpdatedAt` gracefully — prompts user to re-save to start tracking
