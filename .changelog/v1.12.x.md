## Overview

Bug fixes for managed app UI.

## Fixes

### Missing Launch button on managed apps with UI process ports
- Apps with `uiPort: null` but a process with a labeled `ui` port (e.g., `hdiff-ui:5571`) did not show the Launch button
- Both list and single-app API endpoints now auto-derive `uiPort`/`apiPort` from the processes array when not explicitly set
