# Release v0.11.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

This release focuses on security improvements and bug fixes for the AI runner system.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### CLI Runner Security & Reliability
- **Security Warning Fix**: Resolved Node.js DEP0190 deprecation warning in CLI runner by removing unsafe `shell: true` option from child process spawning
- **Improved Argument Handling**: CLI commands now use direct argument passing instead of shell interpretation, preventing potential security vulnerabilities from unescaped arguments
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging for CLI execution showing full command and prompt preview to aid debugging
- **Context**: The `/devtools/runner` page was generating security warnings when executing Claude CLI commands. The fix removes shell interpretation which was unnecessary and insecure, while maintaining full functionality

**Technical Details**:
- Created override in `server/services/runner.js` for `executeCliRun()` function
- Removed `shell: true` option from `spawn()` call (recommended by Node.js security guidelines)
- Arguments are now properly passed as array without shell metacharacter interpretation
- Added runtime patching in `server/index.js` to inject fixed implementation into AI toolkit

**Files Modified**:
- `server/services/runner.js` - New secure CLI execution implementation
- `server/index.js` - Runtime patching to override toolkit's runner
