# Release v0.12.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

This release adds branch management and automated release workflow capabilities to the DevTools Git page.

## Features

### DevTools Git — Branch Update, Comparison & Release PR Workflow
- **Update Branches button**: One-click fetch and fast-forward merge of `dev` and `main` from origin, with automatic stash/restore if the working tree is dirty
- **Branch Comparison panel**: Shows how many commits `dev` is ahead of `main`, with commit list, diff stats (+insertions/-deletions/files changed), displayed as a "Release Status" card
- **Automated Release PR**: "Create Release PR" button triggers a full CoS agent task that pushes commits, updates the changelog, creates a PR from dev to main, iterates with Copilot review feedback (up to 3 rounds), verifies CI, and merges when approved
- **Release Confirmation dialog**: Modal listing the exact steps the agent will perform, preventing accidental releases
- **Push endpoint**: New server endpoint for pushing branches to origin, used by the release workflow

**Server changes**:
- `server/services/git.js` — Added `fetchOrigin`, `updateBranches`, `getBranchComparison`, `push` functions
- `server/routes/git.js` — Added `/update-branches`, `/branch-comparison`, `/push` POST endpoints

**Client changes**:
- `client/src/services/api.js` — Added `updateBranches`, `getBranchComparison`, `pushBranch` API functions
- `client/src/pages/DevTools.jsx` — Expanded GitPage with Update button, Release Status panel, release confirmation dialog, and CoS task integration
