## Overview

Configurable embedding provider for the memory system, plus HealthTab layout improvements.

## Features

- ConfigTab has a new "Memory Embeddings" section for permanent provider/model selection
- Server reinitializes embedding config automatically when provider or model changes

## Improvements
