# Release v1.25.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Reusable ProcessesTab component with per-app process views and a bug fix for clearing failed AI runs.

## 🎉 Features

- **App Processes Tab**: Each app's detail view now has a "Processes" tab showing only that app's PM2 processes with live logs, restart/stop/start controls
- **Reusable ProcessesTab**: Extracted process management UI into a shared component used by both the DevTools Processes page and app detail views
- **Live Activity Log**: Update and Standardize PM2 operations now show real-time step progress (git pull, npm install, restart, analyze, backup, apply) via socket streaming instead of just a spinner
- **Apps Sidebar Dashboard Link**: Apps sidebar section now includes a Dashboard link at top for quick access to the apps list

## 🐛 Fixes

- **Clear Failed Runs**: Fixed "Only filter=failed is supported" error when clicking Clear Failed on the DevTools Runs page — client was sending wrong query parameter
- **CoS Productivity Tab**: Auto-recalculate productivity data from agent history on first visit instead of showing empty state when `productivity.json` hasn't been generated yet
- **Update with stopped PM2 processes**: Clicking Update on an app whose PM2 processes aren't running no longer crashes — restart failures are captured per-process and reported as warnings while the update still succeeds

## 🔧 Improvements

- **Alphabetical app tabs**: App detail tabs are now alphabetically ordered (Automation, Documents, Git, GSD, Processes, Tasks)
