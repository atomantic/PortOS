Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Plan cleanup and documentation reorganization.

## Improvements

### Plan & Documentation Cleanup
- **Extracted M42 spec** to `docs/features/identity-system.md` -- removed ~600 lines from PLAN.md
- **Extracted M40 summary** to `docs/features/agent-skills.md` -- completed milestone moved to feature docs
- **Moved M40 to Completed** -- all 4 phases (skill templates, context compaction, negative routing, deterministic workflows) were done
- **Removed pump.fun content** (M44) -- belongs in pump.funner repo, not PortOS
- **Removed orphaned research docs** -- `pumpfun-data-sources.md` and `kalshibot-health-check-2026-02-17.md` were for other projects
- **Added Scope Boundary rule** to CLAUDE.md -- CoS agents must write research/plans/docs for managed apps in those apps' repos, not PortOS
- **Updated Next Actions** -- focused on M42 Identity System, M7 App Templates, M34 behavioral feedback
