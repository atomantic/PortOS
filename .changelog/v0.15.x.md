# Release v0.15.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Plan cleanup and documentation reorganization.

## Fixes

### CI: Release date placeholder not substituted
- **Fixed `YYYY-MM-DD` never replaced** in release notes -- the `release.yml` workflow substituted version placeholders but not the date placeholder
- **Added date substitution** to both the release body generation and the archived changelog file
- **Backfilled 4 releases** (v0.11.17, v0.12.48, v0.13.20, v0.14.21) with correct dates

### Hardening: Safe JSON parsing & output redaction
- **Replaced raw `JSON.parse` with `readJSONFile`** in `apps.js`, `socialAccounts.js`, `scriptRunner.js` -- corrupted data files no longer crash the server
- **Added null guard** on `data?.apps?.[id]` in `apps.js` to prevent undefined access
- **Added `.catch()` handler** on fire-and-forget `cloneRepoInBackground()` in `brain.js` to prevent unhandled promise rejections
- **Added sensitive output redaction** in `scriptRunner.js` -- env vars containing keys, tokens, passwords, and secrets are now `[REDACTED]` before persisting to `scripts-state.json`

## Improvements

### Plan & Documentation Cleanup
- **Extracted M42 spec** to `docs/features/identity-system.md` -- removed ~600 lines from PLAN.md
- **Extracted M40 summary** to `docs/features/agent-skills.md` -- completed milestone moved to feature docs
- **Moved M40 to Completed** -- all 4 phases (skill templates, context compaction, negative routing, deterministic workflows) were done
- **Removed pump.fun content** (M44) -- belongs in pump.funner repo, not PortOS
- **Removed orphaned research docs** -- `pumpfun-data-sources.md` and `kalshibot-health-check-2026-02-17.md` were for other projects
- **Added Scope Boundary rule** to CLAUDE.md -- CoS agents must write research/plans/docs for managed apps in those apps' repos, not PortOS
- **Updated Next Actions** -- focused on M42 Identity System, M7 App Templates, M34 behavioral feedback
