# Release v1.14.x - Changelog

Released: YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

Housekeeping release — remove sub-directory package-lock files from git tracking to reduce merge noise.

## Improvements

- **Gitignore sub-directory lock files** — removed `client/`, `server/`, and `browser/` package-lock.json from git tracking and added them to `.gitignore`; only the root lock file is committed
